## 🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

---

## 📦 How to Run
```
python ascii_art.py
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Image Upload
The program opens a file dialog and stores the selected image path.

2. Convert to Grayscale
Pillow converts RGB image to grayscale for brightness evaluation.

3. Aspect Ratio Fix + Resize
Characters are taller than wide, so resizing includes an aspect ratio correction.

4. Pixel-to-ASCII Mapping
Brightness mapped to characters: @%#*+=-:. 

5. ASCII Display
Rendered in a Tkinter text widget.

6. Save
Export as .txt or .html (monospace pre block).
